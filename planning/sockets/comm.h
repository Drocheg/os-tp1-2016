 * 2) Client creates 2 FIFOs and sends the two file paths to the server (one for sending
 *      and other for receiving data).
 * 3) Server opens the 2 FIFOs (one for read and other for write) and forks (listening to them).
 * 4) Client also opens the 2 FIFOs.
 * 5) Client and Server can now communicate.
